## Agile Methodology

This project employs Agile Development Methods to oversee the development process and ensure efficient delivery.

##### Kanban Board

The project's Kanban Board can be viewed [here]( https://github.com/users/JohnnySonTrinh/projects/8/views/1

##### EPICS (Milestones) to-do or delete

The epics outline the high-level objectives and functionalities of the project. These can be further broken down into more granular tasks, as specified in the user stories.

##### User Stories Issues to-do or delete

User stories provide detailed descriptions that define the project's functionalities from the user's perspective.

For details to the Epics and User Stories, please visit the project's [Kanban Board]( https://github.com/users/JohnnySonTrinh/projects/8/views/1).

##### The MoSCoW Prioritization Method

The acronym represents Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. To efficiently manage resources and development flow according to urgency and necessity, the MoSCoW prioritization method was utilized. This structured approach helps identify which features are essential for the current phase (Must Have), which can be included if time permits (Should Have), which may be postponed for future iterations (Could Have), and which will be excluded from this iteration or are unlikely to be implemented (Won't Have).
The priorities are reflected on each task with **labels** on each user story on [this project's Kanban board]( https://github.com/users/JohnnySonTrinh/projects/8/views/1)

## Features

##### Navbar

The website features a clean layout and a clear visual hierarchy to facilitate easy navigation. The navigation bar always indicates the user's current location on the site. Navigation elements, including links and buttons, are prominently positioned and clearly labeled.

##### Footer

The footer contains a user-friendly contact form and copyrights information.

##### Home

The Home page serves as an attractive introduction to the website, featuring a concise overview of its offerings.

![feature-home](to-do)

##### About Us

![feature-about](/documentation/features/feature-about-us.png)

##### Error Pages

The project implements a custom HTML error page for the 404 (Not Found) status code to enhance user experience. This error page features a consistent design with the website, provides a clear, user-friendly explanation of the error without technical jargon, and uses straightforward language. Additionally, it includes a visually appealing image that aligns with the website's theme.
