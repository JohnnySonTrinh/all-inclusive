            To better understand the diverse needs for accessible websites, we
            will now explore a range of profiles, each highlighting different
            factors that influence accessibility requirements. These profiles
            will illustrate how individuals, based on their unique
            circumstances—whether it's a disability, socioeconomic challenges,
            or technological limitations—benefit from specific website features.
            By examining their needs, we will show how tailored accessibility
            features, such as keyboard navigation, voice control, or
            customizable text sizes, can make digital spaces more inclusive,
            efficient, and user-friendly for everyone. This will help emphasize
            why designing with accessibility in mind is essential for ensuring
            equal access and participation in the digital world.

              <h2 class="h3 mb-4">David Chambers</h2>
              <p>
                David, a highly skilled lawyer living in New York City, is
                visually impaired. Despite his disability, David is known for
                his exceptional abilities and sharp legal mind. To navigate the
                digital world effectively, he relies on assistive technologies
                like screen readers, which allow him to access and interact with
                online content.
              </p>

              <p>
                For David to perform his job at the highest level, digital
                accessibility is crucial, including:
              </p>

              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong> ⚫ Screen Reader Friendly:</strong> Websites and
                  documents need to be compatible with screen readers, allowing
                  David to listen to and understand content easily.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong>⚫ Clear Navigation:</strong> Logical and consistent
                  navigation helps him move quickly through information without
                  confusion.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong>⚫ Descriptive Alt Text:</strong> All images should
                  include descriptive alt text so that visual content can be
                  conveyed through auditory means.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong>⚫ Keyboard-Friendly Controls:</strong> Keyboard
                  navigation allows David to efficiently use digital platforms
                  without needing a mouse.
                </li>

                Tom, a tech consultant who frequently travels for work, is
                taller and has larger-than-average hands, which sometimes makes
                using small mobile devices challenging. He often needs to access
                detailed technical documents, communicate with clients, and
                manage projects while on the go, so having mobile-friendly and
                accessible websites is crucial for his productivity.
              </p>

              <p>To meet Tom's needs, accessible design should include:</p>

              <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong>⚫ Enlarged Text</strong> Larger, adjustable fonts

                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong>⚫ Larger Touch Targets</strong> Buttons and links
                  should be larger with more space between them to prevent
                  mis-taps when navigating quickly.
                </li>
                <li class="mb-3">

                </li>
                <li class="mb-3">

                  for Tom to locate information without excessive scrolling or
                  precise finger movements.

                <li class="mb-3">
                  <strong>⚫ Voice Command Integration</strong> Voice-activated
                  navigation helps Tom manage emails, review documents, and make
                  quick notes without handling the device directly, which is
                  especially useful in transit.

                Mobile-friendly websites optimized for these needs help Tom stay
