            To better understand the diverse needs for accessible websites, we
            will now explore a range of profiles, each highlighting different
            factors that influence accessibility requirements. These profiles
            will illustrate how individuals, based on their unique
            circumstancesâ€”whether it's a disability, socioeconomic challenges,
            or technological limitationsâ€”benefit from specific website features.
            By examining their needs, we will show how tailored accessibility
            features, such as keyboard navigation, voice control, or
            customizable text sizes, can make digital spaces more inclusive,
            efficient, and user-friendly for everyone. This will help emphasize
            why designing with accessibility in mind is essential for ensuring
            equal access and participation in the digital world.

                David, a highly skilled lawyer living in New York City, is
                visually impaired. Despite his disability, David is known for
                his exceptional abilities and sharp legal mind. To navigate the
                digital world effectively, he relies on assistive technologies
                like screen readers, which allow him to access and interact with
                online content.
              </p>

              <p>
                For David to perform his job at the highest level, digital

                using small mobile devices challenging. He often needs to access
                detailed technical documents, communicate with clients, and
                manage projects while on the go, so having mobile-friendly and

              </p>
